Description :

In a world where human interaction is increasingly digitized, and feelings of loneliness are quietly growing behind the buzz of constant notifications, this simple yet whimsical app offers a playful take on an emotionally complex reality. “Will You Go Out With Me?” is a lightweight, humorous web-based application that invites users into a small, controlled emotional scenario: they're asked a single question — “Do you want to go out with me?” — and are presented with two buttons: “Yes” and “No.” But there’s a twist. The “No” button refuses to cooperate. It jumps away, dodges the cursor, and ultimately makes itself unclickable, leaving “Yes” as the only path forward. If the user clicks “Yes,” they’re rewarded with a sweet animation or page filled with happy faces and a positive message. It’s cheeky, it’s funny — but under the surface, it’s layered with meaning.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core logic revolves around event listeners and DOM manipulation, where the “No” button is programmed to change its position dynamically whenever a hover or click is attempted, creating a frustrating but humorous experience for the user. The "Yes" button, by contrast, is static and provides a single clear outcome — a redirect to a separate HTML page filled with cheerful imagery or emojis. But beyond the coding tricks and the clean UI, the app explores something deeper: the human desire for companionship and validation. In a society where rejections — romantic, social, or even casual — can be emotionally jarring, the app reimagines a world where only acceptance is allowed, however artificial that may seem. The experience is both satirical and comforting: it invites laughs, but also pokes gently at the real emotional voids people sometimes feel in an increasingly lonely digital age.

On the technical side, the application showcases a fun and engaging use of JavaScript interactivity, demonstrating control over browser events and positioning. The logic behind the "No" button movement involves a simple yet effective use of the `mousemove` and `mouseover` events, causing the button to shift its location randomly on the screen every time the user tries to approach it. This is paired with clean and minimal HTML structure and CSS transitions to make the UI feel smooth and responsive. What makes this project stand out, however, is not just the functionality, but the intentional emotional layer built into the experience. The choice to remove the possibility of rejection symbolizes a childlike desire for pure, uncomplicated connection. It’s an honest reflection of how many individuals — particularly in moments of solitude — seek interaction that comes without the risk of pain. The happy face page that follows a “Yes” click acts as a digital hug, a small moment of joy in an otherwise neutral or even lonely browser session.

The index contains the links to the two gifs and the main html file of the homepage. and the yes.html contains the program for when the user selects yes cause the no is unclickable.

From a design perspective, the app embraces minimalism to keep the user’s focus on the experience itself. The use of whitespace, soft colors, and emoji-based feedback is deliberate — offering a lighthearted aesthetic that matches the project's humorous yet emotional tone. As a CS50x project, this application doesn’t just check off the boxes of basic interactivity and web development — it tries to tell a story. It tries to reflect how sometimes, the tools we build with code can express very human things: longing, connection, fear of rejection, and the need to be heard. It challenges users to think about how they engage with digital interactions and how those experiences mirror real-life feelings. In short, this is not just an app that plays a trick — it’s an app that starts a conversation. A simple “Yes” leads to more than a redirect. It opens up a space for smiling, laughing, and reflecting — which, in the end, is what great technology should do.
